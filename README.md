# portfolio
This is the portfolio page I've made for myself as a web-developer.

It was made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript/jQuery. The site showcases the three
apps I developed as part of the Thinkful Front-End Web Development course.
The site is fully responsive across screen sizes using a combination of 
Flexbox and media queries.
