        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          I love theater, games, baking pretzels, and Javascript (not necessarily in that order).
          Shortly after I started learning HTML and CSS, I was bitten hard by the coding bug.
          After developing a love for Javascript logic, I decided to consider that bug a feature.
          Now I develop full-stack, responsive web applications with a focus on intuitive UI and
          maintainable code.
